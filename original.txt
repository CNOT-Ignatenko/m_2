3. Regarding the sufficiency of disclosure of the invention.
According to clause 43 of the Rules, the substantive examination of an application under Article 1386 of the Code includes, inter alia, verification of whether the essence of the invention is disclosed in the application documents, as stipulated in subparagraphs 1-4 of paragraph 2 of Article 1375 of the Code and submitted on the filing date, in sufficient detail to enable the invention to be carried out by a skilled person. Specifically, (clause 53 of the Rules) it is verified whether the application documents, as stipulated in subparagraphs 1-4 of paragraph 2 of Article 1375 of the Code and submitted on the filing date, contain information about the intended purpose of the invention, the technical result provided by the invention, whether the combination of essential features necessary to achieve the technical result specified by the Applicant is disclosed, and whether the rules set out in clauses 36-43, 45-50 of the Requirements applicable to the disclosure of the essence of the invention and the disclosure of information about the possibility of implementing the invention have been observed.
(i) Regarding the technical result:
According to the application materials (description: p. 4), the invention is aimed at providing the use of pyronaridine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and/or artemisinin or a derivative thereof for the prevention or treatment of epidemic RNA virus infections.
(ii) Regarding compliance with the requirements set out in clauses 36-43, 45-50 of the Requirements:
According to clause 45(2) of the Requirements, if an invention is characterized in the claims by using an essential feature expressed in a general concept that encompasses different specific embodiments of the essential feature, or expressed at the level of function or property, the validity of the degree of generalization used by the Applicant to disclose the essential feature of the invention shall be substantiated by providing information on specific embodiments of this essential feature.

For an invention relating to the diagnosis of a specific condition or disease, information about the relationship between the diagnostic factor and the condition or disease shall be provided. Additional data may also be provided to confirm that the used product or method is suitable for the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of the specified disease or condition (obtained, in particular, through experiments on adequate models), with information on doses and regimens of their use.
The Examiner draws the Applicant's attention to the feature “pyronaridine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof” in independent claims 1, 3, 17, 19, and to the feature “artemisinin or a derivative thereof” in independent claims 2, 3, 18, 19, which are expressed in general terms.
The Examiner notes that, according to the application materials (description: p.), the feasibility of the invention (according to independent claim 1) is demonstrated for a composition comprising such a salt of pyronaridine as pyronaridine tetraphosphate; the feasibility of the invention (according to independent claim 2) is demonstrated for a composition comprising such a derivative of artemisinin as artesunate, and also demonstrated for a composition comprising pyronaridine tetraphosphate and artesunate. However, for any other pharmaceutically acceptable salts of pyronaridine and any other derivatives of artemisinin, the feasibility of the invention for the intended purpose with the achievement of the technical result is not shown.
The Examiner notes that it is known from the prior art [Patrick Makary et al., Principles of Salt Formation / UK Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biosciences, 2014. Vol. 2, No. 4, pp. 1-4], that salt formation can have a number of undesirable effects on the properties of a drug and ultimately affect its efficacy in vivo. Firstly, since counterions are therapeutically inactive, the proportion of the drug in the formulation is reduced, leading to an increase in the volume of powder needed for capsule filling and tablet compaction. This, in turn, can result in the need for larger dosages and therefore cause problems with administration. Moreover, the incorporation of counterions into the drug structure can lead to increased formation of hydrates and polymorphic modifications, ultimately increasing the variability of the pharmaceutical properties of the drug. Additionally, salts of strong acids and bases usually have high hygroscopicity, which creates storage problems and shortens the product's shelf life. Finally, since salt forms are ionized particles, their partitioning into lipophilic phases may be reduced. This, in turn, may decrease their permeability through biological membranes (e.g., gastrointestinal membranes) and, consequently, reduce the absorption and bioavailability of the drug (p. 3). It is also known from the prior art [Mashkovsky M.D., Lekarstvennye sredstva [Drugs]. 16th ed., revised and supplemented – Moscow: Novaya Volna, 2012, p. 8, left column] that chemical changes (modifications) of molecules can lead to significant changes in their properties – even to the extent of producing substances with opposite (antagonistic) effects.
Thus, the essence of the inventions in the application documents submitted on the filing date is insufficiently disclosed to enable a skilled person to carry out the invention (clause 53 of the Rules).
The Applicant has the right to specify the feature “pyronaridine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof” in independent claims 1, 3, 17, 19, based on the examples of the implementation of the invention, for example, as “pyronaridine tetraphosphate.” Similarly, the Applicant may specify the feature “artemisinin or a derivative thereof” in independent claims 2, 3, 18, 19, based on the examples of the implementation of the invention, for example, as “artesunate.” Alternatively, the Applicant may provide additional experimental data (these examples will be considered in the decision making on the application as supplementary materials, but the description of the invention  cannot be supplement with these examples (clause 96 of the Rules)) demonstrating the feasibility of the inventions according to independent claims 1, 2, 3, 17, 18, 19 for the intended purpose with the achievement of the technical result across the entire claimed scope.
The Examiner also draws the Applicant's attention to dependent claim 11, which discloses “the pharmaceutical composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, which further comprises at least one other antiviral agent,” and to dependent claim 27, which discloses “the use according to any one of Claims 17 to 19, wherein the medicament further comprises at least one other antiviral agent,” where the feature “at least one other antiviral agent” is expressed in general terms.
The Examiner further points to dependent claim 12, which discloses “the pharmaceutical composition according to Claim 11, wherein the other antiviral agent is selected from the group consisting of a viral replication inhibitor, a helicase inhibitor, a viral protease inhibitor and a viral cell entry inhibitor," and to dependent claim 13, which discloses “the pharmaceutical composition according to Claim 12, wherein the other antiviral agent is selected from the group consisting of ribavirin, interferon, niclosamide and a combination thereof.” Similarly, the Examiner draws the Applicant’s attention to dependent claim 28, which discloses “the use according to Claim 27, wherein the other antiviral agent is selected from the group consisting of a viral replication inhibitor, a helicase inhibitor, a viral protease inhibitor and a viral cell entry inhibitor,” and dependent claim 29, which discloses “the use according to Claim 28, wherein the other antiviral agent is selected from the group consisting of ribavirin, interferon, niclosamide and a combination thereof,” where the features are expressed as alternatives (dependent claims 12, 13, 28, 29).
The Examiner notes that the application materials lack information demonstrating the feasibility of the inventions according to claims 11, 12, 13, 27, 28, 29, with respect to achieving the intended purpose and technical result.
Furthermore, it is known from the prior art [Mashkovsky M.D. Lekarstvennye sredstva [Drugs]: in 2 vols., Vol. 1. – 14th ed. – Moscow: LLC "Novaya Volna", 2001. – 540 pages] that the primary goal of combined drug use is to improve (enhance and broaden the spectrum of) therapeutic effects and reduce side effects. However, to achieve this goal, the properties of each of the components used must be considered. Irrational combinations may worsen the therapeutic effect and intensify or cause new (additional) side effects. In general, drug interactions can be synergistic or antagonistic. Synergism (enhancement of the final effect) can manifest as a simple summation of effects (additive action) or potentiation, where the overall effect exceeds the simple sum of each component's effects. In some cases, a phenomenon known as synergy-antagonism may occur, where some effects of the components are enhanced while others are diminished. Antagonism can also manifest ambiguously, leading to the weakening or disappearance of the pharmacological (therapeutic) effect (p. 11). This information is also supported by [Ting-Chao Chou. Drug Combination Studies and Their Synergy Quantification Using the Chou-Talalay Method/Cancer Research, 2010, Vol. 70, No. 2, pp. 440-446], which reports that when two drugs are combined, they can behave as a third drug with many unpredictable effects, and that synergy or antagonism must be determined, not predicted (pp. 441, 442).
Therefore, based on the above, information on the feasibility of the invention for the intended purpose with the achievement of the technical result for the composition comprising pyronaridine tetraphosphate, the composition comprising artesunate, and the composition comprising both pyronaridine tetraphosphate and artesunate, cannot be extrapolated to compositions that further comprise other antiviral agents. This is because the interaction of pyronaridine tetraphosphate and/or artesunate with other antiviral agents in the composition may result in either synergistic or antagonistic effects.
Thus, the essence of the inventions in the application documents submitted on the filing date is insufficiently disclosed to enable a skilled person to carry out the invention (clause 53 of the Rules).
The Applicant has the right to cancel dependent claims 11, 12, 13, 27, 28, 29, or alternatively, to provide a sufficient number of experimental data (these examples will be considered in the decision making on the application as supplementary materials, but the description of the invention cannot be supplemented with these examples (clause 105 of the Rules)) confirming the feasibility of the inventions according to claims 11, 12, 13, 27, 28, 29 for the intended purpose with the achievement of the technical result across the entire claimed scope.
The Examiner also draws the Applicant's attention to the feature “epidemic RNA virus infections” in independent claims 1, 2, 3, 17, 18, 19, which is expressed in general terms.
The Examiner notes that the application materials (p.) demonstrate the inhibitory effect of pyronaridine tetraphosphate and/or artesunate on SARS-CoV-2, but the feasibility of the inventions according to claims 1, 2, 3, 17, 18, 19 across the entire claimed scope, i.e., for the prevention or treatment of any other epidemic RNA virus infections, is not demonstrated in the application materials.
The Examiner further notes that it is well known from the prior art (see, for example, Antiviral Drugs in General Practice // Medical Scientific and Practical Portal. Treating Physician. List of data [online] 16.11.2007 [accessed 20.07.2023] - found on the Internet: URL: https://web.archive.org/web/20201130082920/https://www.lvrach.ru/2007/09/4716579) that antiviral drugs have specific mechanisms of action, and therefore, a positive effect of an antiviral drug for treating one disease caused by one virus cannot be extrapolated to other diseases caused by other viruses (e.g., hepatitis virus, HIV, cytomegalovirus, etc.).
Thus, there is a violation of clauses 45(2) and 50(2) of the Requirements, meaning that the essence of the inventions is not disclosed in the application documents submitted on the filing date in sufficient detail to enable a skilled person to carry out the invention (clause 53 of the Rules).
The Applicant has the right to specify the feature “epidemic RNA virus infections” in independent claims 1, 2, 3, 17, 18, 19, based on the original application materials, or alternatively, to provide a sufficient number of experimental data (these examples will be considered in the decision making on the application as supplementary materials, but the description of the invention cannot be supplemented with these examples (clause 105 of the Rules)) confirming the use of the compositions according to independent claims 1, 2, 3, and the use of a therapeutically effective amount of artemisinin or a derivative thereof and/or pyronaridine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the prevention or treatment of epidemic RNA virus infections other than those disclosed in the current application materials.
4. Regarding the patentability of the invention
According to Clause 64 of the Rules, the assessment of novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability of the invention is conducted after completion of examinations provided for in clauses 47-49, 53, 55, and 56 of the Rules with a positive result, establishing priority of the invention, and conducting an information search.
To accelerate the prosecution, the Examiner notes the following:
According to clause 1 of Article 1350 of the Code, an invention is granted legal protection if it is novel, involves an inventive step, and is industrially applicable.
According to clause 70 of the Rules, during the examination of novelty, an invention is deemed to be novel if it is established that the combination of features of the invention presented in an independent claim of the invention is not known from information that became publicly available in the world before the priority date of the invention (hereinafter referred to as the prior art). An invention relating to a product that differs from a known product only by a generic concept is considered to comply with the novelty condition if the generic concept, reflecting the intended purpose and/or field of use of the claimed product, implies that the claimed product has features (characteristics) not included by the Applicant in the claims that distinguish the claimed product from the known product. If the distinction of the generic concept is based solely on properties inherently belonging to the claimed product, including previously unknown properties, the claimed product is not considered novel. In this case, the Applicant has the right to characterize the proposed invention in the claims in the form of use of the product for a specific intended purpose, as indicated in the generic concept. An invention relating to a product expressed using characteristics of the method of its production is considered not to comply with the novelty condition if the resulting product is known from the prior art. A claimed invention characterized as use for a specific intended purpose is considered not to comply with the novelty condition if the prior art discloses the use of the same product or method for the same intended purpose. When examining the novelty of an invention relating to a composition, the features specified in subparagraph 3 of clause 39 of the Requirements for application documents are not taken into account.
The closest prior art to the present inventions according to independent claims 1 and 17 is the technical solution disclosed in the information source, Thomas R. Lane et al., Repurposing the antimalarial pyronaridine tetraphosphate to protect against Ebola virus infection / PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, 2019, 13(11), pp.1-26, [D1]. D1 discloses a pharmaceutical composition for protection against Ebola virus infection, comprising pyronaridine tetraphosphate and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (see Abstract, pp. 6-7).
Thus, the present inventions according to independent claims 1 and 17 may be deemed not to comply with the patentability condition of “novelty” according to clause 70 of the Rules.
The closest prior art to the present inventions according to independent claims 2 and 18 is the technical solution disclosed in the information source US 2009156473 A1, 18.06.2009 [D2]. D2 discloses a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of acute and chronic infections caused by viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza, the pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one inhibitor of a proteasome and one inhibitor of a protein-folding enzyme as active components, where the inhibitor of a protein-folding enzyme may be selected from artemisinin (description: paragraphs [0002], [0149]).
Thus, the present inventions according to independent claims 2 and 18 may be deemed not to comply with the patentability condition of “novelty” according to clause 70 of the Rules.
Additionally, the prior art source US 2015196530 A1, 16.07.2015 [D3], discloses a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an artemisinin-related compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, where the artemisinin-related compound is selected from the group consisting of dihydroartemisinin, artesunate, artemether, and arteether (description: paragraphs [0008], [0053], [0056]). D3 discloses the use of artemisinin for the treatment of virus infections caused by RNA viruses (description: paragraph [0031]).
Regarding the intended purpose “for the prevention or treatment of epidemic RNA virus infections” of the composition according to independent claim 2, since D3 discloses a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an artemisinin-related compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, wherein the artemisinin-related compound is selected from the group consisting of dihydroartemisinin, artesunate, artemether, and arteether (description: paragraphs [0008], [0053], [0056]), the intended purpose “for the prevention or treatment of epidemic RNA virus infections” would be inherent to the composition of D3.
Thus, the present invention according to independent claim 2 may be deemed not to comply with the patentability condition of “novelty” according to clause 70 of the Rules.
The closest prior art to the present invention according to independent claim 3 is the technical solution disclosed in the information source WO 2006049391 A1, 11.05.2006 [D4]. D4 discloses a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of malaria, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of pyronaridine or a salt thereof and a therapeutically effective amount of artemisinin or a derivative thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (see claims: claim 1).
Regarding the intended purpose “for the prevention or treatment of epidemic RNA virus infections” of the composition according to independent claim 3, since D4 discloses a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of pyronaridine or a salt thereof and a therapeutically effective amount of artemisinin or a derivative thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (see claims: claim 1), the intended purpose “for the prevention or treatment of epidemic RNA virus infections” would be inherent to the composition of D4.
Thus, the present invention according to independent claim 3 may be deemed not to comply with the patentability condition of “novelty” according to clause 70 of the Rules.
As for independent claim 19, the closest prior art to the present invention is D2, which discloses a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of acute and chronic infections caused by viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza, the pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one inhibitor of a proteasome and one inhibitor of a protein-folding enzyme as active components, wherein the inhibitor of a protein-folding enzyme may be selected from artemisinin (description: paragraphs [0002], [0149]).
The difference between the present invention according to independent claim 19 and the technical solution from D2 is that artemisinin is used in combination with pyronaridine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
However, from the prior art D4, it is known that a pharmaceutical composition comprises a therapeutically effective amount of pyronaridine or a salt thereof and a therapeutically effective amount of artemisinin or a derivative thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (see claims: claim 1), i.e., the combination use of pyronaridine or a salt thereof and artemisinin or a derivative thereon is known. Additionally, from the prior art (see D'Alessandro S. The Use of Antimalarial Drugs against Viral Infection. Microorganisms. 2020 Jan 8, Vol.8, No.85, pp.1-26 [D5]), it is known that antimalarial drugs are useful for treating virus infections, and from D1, it is known that a pharmaceutical composition for protection against Ebola virus infection comprises pyronaridine tetraphosphate and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, i.e., the antiviral activity of pyronaridine tetraphosphate is known (abstract, pp. 6-7).
Regarding the technical result, which is to provide the use of pyronaridine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and/or artemisinin or a derivative thereof for the prevention or treatment of epidemic RNA virus infections, D2 discloses a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of acute and chronic infections caused by viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza.
Thus, the present invention according to independent claim 19 may be deemed not to comply with the patentability condition of “inventive step” according to clause 75 of the Rules.
Regarding dependent claims 4, 5, 20, 21, it is known from D1 that a pharmaceutical composition for protection against Ebola virus infection contains pyronaridine tetraphosphate and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (abstract, pp. 6-7).
Regarding dependent claims 6, 7, 8, it is known from D4 that artemisinin or a derivative thereof and pyronaridine or a salt thereof are present in a weight ratio of 1:1 to 1:6 (see claim: claim 2).
Regarding dependent claims 9 and 10 (in the alternative where dependent claim 9 refers to independent claim 2), it is known from D3 that a composition comprises a therapeutically effective amount of an artemisinin-related compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, where the artemisinin-related compound is selected from the group consisting of dihydroartemisinin, artesunate, artemether, and arteether (description: paragraphs [0008], [0053], [0056]).
Regarding dependent claims 9 and 10 (in the alternative where dependent claim 9 refers to independent claim 3), it is known from D4 that the artemisinin derivative may be selected from dihydroartemisinin, artesunate, artemether, and arteether (description: p.3, paragraph 25).
Regarding dependent claim 14 (in the alternative where dependent claim 14 refers to independent claim 1), it is known from D1 that a pharmaceutical composition for protection against Ebola virus infection comprises pyronaridine tetraphosphate and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (abstract, pp. 6-7).
Regarding dependent claims 14, 15 (in the alternative where dependent claim 14 refers to independent claim 2), 30 and 31 (in the alternative where dependent claim 30 refers to independent claim 18), it is known from D2 that a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of acute and chronic infections caused by viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza, comprises a therapeutically effective amount of at least one inhibitor of a proteasome and one inhibitor of a protein-folding enzyme as active components, wherein the inhibitor of a protein-folding enzyme may be selected from artemisinin (description: paragraphs [0002], [0149]).
Regarding dependent claims 20, 21, and 30 (in the alternative where dependent claim 30 refers to independent claim 17), it is known from D1 that a pharmaceutical composition for protection against Ebola virus infection comprises pyronaridine tetraphosphate and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (abstract, pp. 6-7).
Thus, if the features of dependent claims 4-10, 14, 15, 20, 21, 30, 31 are introduced into the corresponding independent claims, independent claims 1, 2, 3, 17, 18 may be deemed not to comply with the patentability condition of “novelty” according to clause 70 of the Rules.
Regarding dependent claims 20 and 21 (in the alternative where dependent claim 20 refers to independent claim 19), it is known from D1 that a pharmaceutical composition for protection against Ebola virus infection comprises pyronaridine tetraphosphate and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (abstract, pp. 6-7).
Regarding dependent claims 22-24, it is known from D4 that a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of malaria comprises a therapeutically effective amount of pyronaridine or a salt thereof and a therapeutically effective amount of artemisinin or a derivative thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, wherein artemisinin or a derivative thereof and pyronaridine or a salt thereof are in a weight ratio of 1:1 to 1:6 (claim: claim 2).
Regarding dependent claims 25 and 26, it is known from D3 that a composition comprises a therapeutically effective amount of an artemisinin-related compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, wherein the artemisinin-related compound is selected from the group consisting of dihydroartemisinin, artesunate, artemether, and arteether (description: paragraphs [0008], [0053], [0056]).
Regarding dependent claims 30 and 31 (in the alternative where dependent claim 30 refers to independent claim 19), it is known from D2 that a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of acute and chronic infections caused by viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza, comprises a therapeutically effective amount of at least one inhibitor of a proteasome and one inhibitor of a protein-folding enzyme as active components, wherein the inhibitor of a protein-folding enzyme may be selected from artemisinin (description: paragraphs [0002], [0149]).
Thus, if the features of dependent claims 20, 21 (in the alternative where dependent claim 20 refers to independent claim 19), 22-26, 30-31 (in the alternative where dependent claim 30 refers to independent claim 19) are introduced into the corresponding independent claims, independent claims 1, 2, 3, 17, and 18 may be deemed not to comply with the patentability  condition of “inventive step” according to clause 75 of the Rules.
